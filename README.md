Simple-Web-Server
=================

A very simple, fast, multithreaded, platform independent HTTP and HTTPS server and client library implemented using C++11 and Boost.Asio. Created to be an easy way to make REST resources available from C++ applications. 

See also https://github.com/eidheim/Simple-WebSocket-Server for an easy way to make WebSocket/WebSocket Secure endpoints in C++. 

### Features

* Thread pool
* Platform independent
* HTTPS support
* HTTP persistent connection (for HTTP/1.1)
* Client supports chunked transfer encoding
* Timeouts, if any of Server::timeout_request and Server::timeout_content are >0 (default: Server::timeout_request=5 seconds, and Server::timeout_content=300 seconds)
* Simple way to add REST resources using regex for path, and anonymous functions
* Possibility to flush response to clients synchronously (Server::Response::flush).

###Usage

See http_examples.cpp or https_examples.cpp for example usage. 

See particularly the JSON-POST (using Boost.PropertyTree) and the GET /match/[number] examples, which are most relevant.

The default_resource includes example use of Server::Response::flush. 

### Dependencies

* Boost C++ libraries
* For HTTPS: OpenSSL libraries 

### Compile and run

Compile with a C++11 compliant compiler:

Simple-WebSocket-Server
=================

A very simple, fast, multithreaded, platform independent WebSocket (WS) and WebSocket Secure (WSS) server and client library implemented using C++11, Boost.Asio and OpenSSL. Created to be an easy way to make WebSocket endpoints in C++.

See also https://github.com/eidheim/Simple-Web-Server for an easy way to make REST resources available from C++ applications. 

### Features

* RFC 6455 mostly supported: text/binary frames, ping-pong, connection close with status and reason.
* Thread pool
* Platform independent
* WebSocket Secure support
* Timeouts, if any of SocketServer::timeout_request and SocketServer::timeout_idle are >0 (default: SocketServer::timeout_request=5 seconds, and SocketServer::timeout_idle=0 seconds; no timeout on idle connections)
* Simple way to add WebSocket endpoints using regex for path, and anonymous functions
* An easy to use WebSocket and WebSocket Secure client library
* C++ bindings to the following OpenSSL methods: Base64, MD5, SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512 (found in crypto.hpp)

###Usage

See ws_examples.cpp or wss_examples.cpp for example usage. 

### Dependencies

* Boost C++ libraries 
* OpenSSL libraries

### Compile

Compile with a C++11 supported compiler:

```sh
>>>>>>> upstream/master
cmake .
make
```

#### HTTP

Run the server and client examples: `./http_examples`

Direct your favorite browser to for instance http://localhost:8080/

#### HTTPS

Before running the server, an RSA private key (server.key) and an SSL certificate (server.crt) must be created. Follow, for instance, the instructions given here (for a self-signed certificate): http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html

Run the server and client examples: `./https_examples`

Direct your favorite browser to for instance https://localhost:8080/

#### Run server and client examples

### WS

```sh
./ws_examples
```

### WSS

Before running the WSS-examples, an RSA private key (server.key) and an SSL certificate (server.crt) must be created. Follow, for instance, the instructions given here (for a self-signed certificate): http://www.akadia.com/services/ssh_test_certificate.html

Then:
```
./wss_examples
```
